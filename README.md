DNAlytics 🧬

A Bioinformatics Analysis Tool

📌 Overview

DNAlytics is a Python-based bioinformatics project designed to analyze DNA sequences. It performs key operations such as:

Calculating nucleotide frequencies

Finding complementary and reverse-complementary sequences

Translating DNA into protein sequences

Searching for specific motifs

This project was developed as part of my learning journey in Bioinformatics & Python programming.

🚀 Features

✅ Nucleotide counting

✅ DNA transcription (DNA → RNA)

✅ DNA to protein translation

✅ GC content calculation

✅ Motif search

✅ Clean, beginner-friendly Python code

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, collections
